1) time zone working: it's now asigned automatically
   according to date, e.g
       for date='2003-04-12', timezone = -7000
       for date='2003-12-12', timezone = -8000
   (finally I learned how to use strftime ;-)

2) explanation for etr == etrn == etrtilt == 0.0:
   According to http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/codes_algs/solpos/:
   etr       0.0 at night  
   etrn      0.0 at night
   etrtilt   0.0 when cosinc is less than 0    

   cosinc (cosine of solar incidence angle on panel) is now
   also reported with the -r option.

   sretr/ssetr are also reported in HH:MM format with option -rv
   so it's easier to check resulting etr*.

let me know.

cimis.hour_angle is being implemented according to the following:

* will work on a given day (current mapset, by default)

* Since sunrise/set times are different across the region, suppose as an
  example that minimum sunrise and maximum sunset times for the whole 
  region are 0550 and 1720 respectively. 

* given an interval = 30 mins, values ha(t) will be generated for
  t = 0530, 0600, 0630, ..., 1700, 1730. Each ha(t) is calculated as:
       ha(t) = MAX { srha(t), hrang(t) }
       
  [you also sketched something similar for MINs; which one is needed? both?...]
       
* for each ha(t) a raster will be generated, say 'ha0600' containing all 
  ha(0600) values over the region.
  
* Maybe r.solpos itself could include this function with a new option
  ha=PREFIX

Any comments/corrections?
Thanks!

	Time zone included in date (optional)
	r.solpos  date="2003-04-21T16:31:21 -0500" ... 
	I haven't figured out how to use the time.h C functions to deal with 
	names like PST8PDT.

	r.solpos -r now working

Based on the r.sunmask code, I wrote a simplified version (r.solpos)
that just calculates the sun azimuth, sun angle above horz., and 
sunrise/sunset times, given a location/date/time. Basically it runs
like ``r.sunmask -s''. The program is under /home/goes/bin/ .

I can now proceed with the specific functionality you want from this
code. Could you please remind me the input/output specification you want?

Carlos,

The libproj under /usr/lib, is probably a later version and may be why
it doesn't work.  It certainly works for lots of other routines.  It's
part of the 'proj' package:  I have noticed that grass doesn't try and
find this library though, so they must compile it themselves.

Which include file did you use?

quinn@ceres:~$ dlocate /usr/lib/libproj.a
proj: /usr/lib/libproj.a

quinn@ceres:~$ dpkg -L proj | grep /usr/lib
/usr/lib
/usr/lib/libproj.so.0.3.1
/usr/lib/libproj.la
/usr/lib/libproj.a
/usr/lib/libproj.so.0
/usr/lib/libproj.so

I'll compile the latest grass today.
