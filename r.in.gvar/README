Modification History:
Oct 22, 2008 (HSU): Modified original "GrassWriter.cpp", "GrassWriter.h",
and "create_grass_files.cpp" into "grasswriterLib.cpp", "grasswriterLib.h"
and "create_grasslib_files.cpp" separately.

Nov 21, 2008 (HSU): Changed the package into a GRASS module with module
name: r.in.gvar.

Compiled on CentOS 5.0 with GRASS v. 6.3 worked.
May require "make_mapset.c" for GRASS v.6.2

To test run:

  1) First create GISDBASE directory (any where in your computer);
  2) Create database location name directory if it not exits;
  3) Copy "MAPSET" : "PERMANENT" from existing database 
     to the database location directory;
  4) Check GRASS initial file: ~/.grassrc for gisdbase, location, and mapset;
  5) Edit the following files: "setenv.sh" and "run-r.in.gvar"
     to make sure that GRASS module options and flags are given.

  
     > source setenv.sh (if it is csh or tcsh) 
     > ./run-r.in.gvar
